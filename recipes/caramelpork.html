<h3>Description</h3>
Kaw Sach Chrouk (Caramelized Pork Belly soup) has been my favorite Cambodian soup ever since I was a child. It's both sweet and savoury AND the boiled eggs are a must have in this dish.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork belly</li>
        <li>Sweet, dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Eggs, as many as you wish</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First wash your rice several times before placing it in a rice cooker or pot. While rice is cooking, boil your eggs as you prepare the caramel base.</li>
        <li>Caramelize the sugar over medium-low heat until brown.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and add in the fish sauce and soy sauces. Stir until sugar and sauces are combined.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back to medium-high and add in the pork. Mix well and stir fry until meat turns brown.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, pour enough water into the pot to just barely cover the meat. Add in your hard boiled eggs and place a lid on the pot and let it come to a boil before turning down the heat and letting it simmer for xx minutes.</li>
        <li>Once finished, serve with a bowl of warm rice.</li>

    </ol>
